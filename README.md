## How It Works

ðŸ‘‰If you're unfamiliar with the game, the rules are very simple flip over two hidden cards at a time to locate the one that match! The game board consists of sixteen cards arranged randomly in a grid.
 Each card is with of different animals on one side. Each turn:-) 
 
 â–ª A player flips one card over to reveal its underlying animal. <br>
 â–ª The player then turns over a second card, trying to find the corresponding card with same animal. <br>
 â–ª If the cards match, both cards stay flipped over. <br>
 â–ª If the cards do not match, both cards are returned to their initial hidden state.
 â–ª The game ends once all cards have been correctly matched.
